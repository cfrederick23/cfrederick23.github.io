<h1>Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design</h1>

<p>
This enhancement centered on the introduction of the <code>RescueAnimalFactory</code> class to the Grazioso Salvare application, which was initially developed in the IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course. This class is pivotal in implementing design patterns that contribute to a more modular and maintainable codebase. 
</p>

<h2>About the Enhancement</h2>

<p>
The introduction of the <code>RescueAnimalFactory</code> class represents a significant shift towards a more structured and scalable software design. This factory class encapsulates the creation logic for <code>RescueAnimal</code>, <code>Dog</code>, and <code>Monkey</code> objects, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns. This enhancement was implemented to address the need for a more efficient way to manage the instantiation of animal objects and their respective data management within the system.
</p>

<h2>Alignment with Course Outcomes</h2>

<p>
This enhancement directly aligns with the course outcome of "Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts". By refactoring the application to include the <code>RescueAnimalFactory</code> class, I demonstrated my ability to employ well-founded software engineering principles to improve the design and structure of the application, making it more adaptable and easier to understand for other developers.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>

<p>
One of the main challenges encountered during this enhancement was ensuring that the factory class seamlessly integrated with the existing system without disrupting the current functionalities. Through this process, I deepened my understanding of design patterns and their practical applications in software development, particularly in enhancing code maintainability and scalability.
</p>

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

<p>
The successful implementation of this enhancement showcased several key skills, including advanced object-oriented programming, application of software design patterns, and the ability to refactor and improve existing codebases for greater efficiency and maintainability.
