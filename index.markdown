# Welcome to My ePortfolio

This ePortfolio is a culmination of my studies in the Bachelor’s of Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). The primary aim of this ePortfolio is to present the enhancements made to a foundational Java-based application, which I developed earlier in my coursework. These enhancements illustrate my growth and proficiency in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I have included a link to a code review video that explains both the original state of the project and the ways I planned to enhance it throughout the course of my capstone project.

## Professional Self-Assessment

### Reflection on Educational Journey
As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program at SNHU, this ePortfolio encapsulates the depth and breadth of my capabilities in **software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases**. My educational path has been transformative, granting me a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. This journey culminates in the capstone project presented here, which serves as a testament to my growth and proficiency in applying complex computer science principles in practical scenarios.

### Purpose and Scope of the Capstone Project

The primary objective of this capstone project is to select artifact(s) to enhance in three key areas: **1) software engineering and design, 2) algorithms and data structures, and 3) databases**. The aim is to demonstrate comprehensive application and mastery of computer science principles toward achieving designated course outcomes. For this endeavor, the artifact chosen is a Java-based console application developed for Grazioso Salvare, a hypothetical entity aimed at connecting rescue animals with potential rescue mission opportunities. Originating from the IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course, this project, finalized in April 2022, served as an introductory platform to object-oriented programming. It was designed to manage and oversee rescue animal data, offering an administrative interface for managing animal records within the system. This specific artifact was enhanced in all three categories to exhibit continuity and depth in my application of these principles. The first enhancement involved implementing the `RescueAnimalFactory` class to centralize object instantiation, improving modularity and scalability. The second enhancement optimized search functionality through the implementation of a hash map, greatly enhancing the efficiency of animal searches. The third enhancement transitioned the system to a robust SQLite database, incorporating secure login mechanisms through hashing and salting of passwords and enhancing overall security with the use of Java's PreparedStatements. Each enhancement was carefully designed to highlight specific competencies and outcomes of the program.

### Achievements of Course Outcomes
- **Course Outcome 1: Collaborative Environments**
  I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by developing a modular and scalable architecture that supports simultaneous multi-contributor inputs without compromising system integrity.

- **Course Outcome 2: Professional-Quality Communications**
  I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by utilizing JavaDoc comments to enhance the legibility and instructional value of the code.

- **Course Outcome 3: Algorithmic Solutions Design**
  I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution by implementing a hash map to optimize search functionalities, demonstrating effective use of data structures.

- **Course Outcome 4: Innovative Computing Techniques**
  I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by integrating a SQLite database and employing Java's PreparedStatement.

- **Course Outcome 5: Security Mindset**
  I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by implementing advanced password handling techniques and using prepared statements to protect against SQL injection.

### Summary
My coursework and enhancements made throughout this program have imbued me with crucial skills for today’s technology-driven workplaces. This ePortfolio not only showcases my technical skills but also my holistic approach to synthesizing these competencies to build comprehensive, secure software solutions. It demonstrates my readiness to contribute effectively in the field of computer science, particularly in roles that require rigorous analysis and strategic foresight.
