# Welcome to My ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment
As a Computer Science student at SNHU since August 2021, with a concentration in Data Analysis from September 2023, I've honed my skills in object-oriented programming, software documentation, and rigorous testing. These skills are vital in my career as a medical professional liability insurance underwriter, where analytical precision and effective data handling are paramount. Through this ePortfolio, I showcase the culmination of my academic journey and the practical application of my knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview
**Origin and Selection:** The centerpiece of this ePortfolio is a Java-based application developed initially for Grazioso Salvare during the IT 145 course. This project was chosen for its potential to demonstrate significant enhancements in software engineering, algorithms, and databases.

**Objective and Enhancements:**
- **Software Engineering and Design**: Introduced a factory design pattern to streamline object creation, enhancing modularity and scalability.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Optimized search functionalities by implementing hash maps, drastically improving search efficiency.
- **Databases**: Transitioned from in-memory storage to a robust SQLite database, enhancing data management and security.

Each enhancement underscores my ability to innovate within my field and reflects targeted outcomes of the Computer Science curriculum.

## Enhancements Overview
### [Software Engineering and Design](./enhancement-one.html)
Introduced the `RescueAnimalFactory`, enhancing the system's architecture to improve flexibility and scalability. This foundational enhancement underpins subsequent enhancements.

### [Algorithms and Data Structures](./enhancement-two.html)
Focused on optimizing data retrieval by implementing hash maps, significantly reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for key operations.

### [Databases](./enhancement-three.html)
Implemented a SQLite database to provide robust data management and security features, replacing the less efficient in-memory storage solution.
