# Welcome to My ePortfolio
As I near the completion of my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analysis at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), this ePortfolio reflects the culmination of rigorous academic training and hands-on project work. It showcases a collection of refined projects that represent not only my technical skills in software development, data structures, algorithms, and databases but also my ability to apply these skills in practical, real-world scenarios.

# Professional Self-Assessment
My academic endeavor in Computer Science at SNHU has endowed me with an array of skills pivotal for today's tech landscape. This ePortfolio highlights one multifaceted project, refined through three enhancements, to demonstrate my acumen in software engineering, sophisticated algorithm design, and robust database management.

# Project Overview
**Origin and Selection:** The centerpiece of this ePortfolio is a Java-based application developed initially during the IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course. This project was chosen for its potential to demonstrate significant enhancements in software engineering, algorithms, and databases.

**Objective and Enhancements:**
- **Software Engineering and Design**: Introduced a factory design pattern to streamline object creation, enhancing modularity and scalability.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Optimized search functionalities by implementing hash maps, drastically improving search efficiency.
- **Databases**: Transitioned from in-memory storage to a robust SQLite database, enhancing data management and security.

Each enhancement underscores my ability to innovate within my field and reflects targeted outcomes of the Computer Science curriculum.

# Enhancements Overview
## [Software Engineering and Design](./enhancement-one.html)
Introduced the `RescueAnimalFactory`, enhancing the system's architecture to improve flexibility and scalability. This foundational enhancement underpins subsequent enhancements.

## [Algorithms and Data Structures](./enhancement-two.html)
Focused on optimizing data retrieval by implementing hash maps, significantly reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for key operations.

## [Databases](./enhancement-three.html)
Implemented a SQLite database to provide robust data management and security features, replacing the less efficient in-memory storage solution.
