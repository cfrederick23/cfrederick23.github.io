## Welcome to My ePortfolio

This ePortfolio is a culmination of my studies in the Bachelor’s of Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). The primary aim of this ePortfolio is to present the enhancements made to a foundational Java-based application, which I developed earlier in my coursework. These enhancements illustrate my growth and proficiency in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Database Management. I have included links to a code review video that explain both the original state of the project and the subsequent enhancements made during my capstone project.

## Self-Assessment

During my time at SNHU, I have honed my abilities in tackling complex computational problems and developing robust software solutions. Initially attracted to the realm of data analysis within computer science, my academic projects have consistently pushed the boundaries of my knowledge and technical skills. This capstone project represents the pinnacle of my educational experience, allowing me to refine and showcase key projects that exemplify my capabilities as a software developer.

For the capstone, I chose to enhance a Java-based application that was initially created as part of the IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course. This project initially demonstrated my ability to design and implement functional software solutions. Through the capstone enhancements, I have significantly improved the application’s architecture, incorporating advanced algorithms, and transitioning to a robust SQLite database system. Each enhancement was methodically applied, reflecting my systematic approach to software development and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

My ability to integrate complex data structures and optimize database interactions speaks to my readiness to contribute effectively in a professional programming environment. I pride myself on writing clean, well-documented, and efficient code, adhering to best practices in software design and object-oriented principles. The skills and knowledge I have developed at SNHU are thoroughly applied in this project, preparing me for future challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.

## Artifact Enhancements

- **Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design**: Implemented a factory design pattern through the `RescueAnimalFactory` to streamline object creation processes, which enhances the modularity and scalability of the application. [Read More](./enhancement-one.html)
  
- **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**: Optimized the search functionality by implementing hash maps, improving the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for key operations, demonstrating efficient algorithm utilization. [Read More](./enhancement-two.html)
  
- **Enhancement Three: Databases**: Enhanced the application’s data handling capabilities by integrating a SQLite database, replacing the previous in-memory storage system. This improvement significantly boosts the application's data management and security. [Read More](./enhancement-three.html)
