This course deepened my understanding of software security, stressing the need to anticipate potential threats and implement preventive measures to protect sensitive information.

## Integration and Professional Growth through Capstone Enhancements

Focusing on the 'Computer Science Capstone' (CS 499) course, I was tasked with selecting up to three artifacts from my previous coursework to enhance in three critical areas: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I opted to concentrate my efforts on a single artifact, the Grazioso Salvare project, which I enhanced across all three categories. This project, originally developed in the 'Foundation in Application Development' (IT 145) course, provided a simple platform with potential for demonstrating a wide array of computer science skills. The enhancements made were not only aimed at showcasing my growth in these areas but also at achieving the five designated course outcomes, thus illustrating significant professional development.

The first enhancement focused on software engineering and design, where I introduced the `RescueAnimalFactory` class to improve the modularity and scalability of the application. This adjustment was crucial for demonstrating my understanding of design patterns and how they can be applied to enhance software architecture. By centralizing object instantiation, I streamlined the creation process of animal objects within the system, making the codebase more manageable and adaptable to future changes.

For the algorithms and data structures enhancement, I tackled the optimization of the search functionality by implementing a hash map to search animals by name, which dramatically improved the search operation's time complexity from O(n) to O(1). This enhancement not only showcased my ability to integrate complex data structures effectively but also highlighted the importance of optimizing software for performance, a critical skill in developing high-performance applications.

The final enhancement involved transitioning the system to utilize a robust SQLite database, enhancing the application’s ability to handle more complex data interactions securely and efficiently. This move was aimed at boosting the system's performance and security, demonstrating my proficiency in database management and the implementation of security measures such as prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
