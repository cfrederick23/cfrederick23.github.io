[Download Enhancement Three](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFJV_Pbotwh6q2cz6HsYjXO4wnQ2x-DL/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

This third enhancement focuses on a substantial upgrade in the data management capabilities of the Grazioso Salvare application, a Java-based console application originally developed in the IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course. By integrating a robust SQLite database, this enhancement transitioned the project from rudimentary data handling to sophisticated, secure, and scalable data management.

## About the Enhancement

The enhancement involved replacing the in-memory storage with a SQLite database, which included designing a relational database schema and implementing CRUD functionalities for rescue animals, users, and reservations. This change not only improved the application's data persistence but also allowed for more complex data relationships and efficient data manipulation. Key features such as user authentication, role-based functionalities, and advanced security measures were also implemented to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data.

## Alignment with Course Outcomes

The integration of the database directly supports several course outcomes:

- It exemplifies the use of innovative techniques and well-founded skills in database management, enhancing the application's functionality and demonstrating my ability to implement complex computing solutions.
- By employing secure coding practices, including the use of Java's PreparedStatement to avoid SQL injection threats, this enhancement also showcases the development of a security mindset, crucial for protecting data and resources against adversarial exploits.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating the SQLite database presented challenges in maintaining data integrity and security during the transition from in-memory storage. This process required a deep understanding of database security protocols and careful planning to ensure seamless integration without compromising existing functionalities. The experience enhanced my skills in database management and security, reinforcing my ability to address and solve complex software development issues.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through this enhancement, I demonstrated advanced capabilities in database management and security implementation. The successful integration of the SQLite database showcases not only my technical proficiency in handling complex data systems but also my commitment to ensuring robust security measures within software applications.
