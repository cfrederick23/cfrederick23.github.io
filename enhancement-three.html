<h1>Enhancement Three: Databases</h1>

<p>
The third enhancement to the Grazioso Salvare application involved a significant shift in data management by integrating a SQLite database. This enhancement was built upon the foundational improvements established in Enhancement One and diverged from Enhancement Two's in-memory data management approach to provide a more robust, scalable, and secure data storage solution.
</p>

<h2>About the Enhancement</h2>

<p>
Transitioning to a SQLite database involved designing a relational database schema, creating tables for rescue animals, users, and reservations, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. This enhancement greatly improved the application's data persistence, allowing for more complex data relationships and efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
</p>

<h2>Alignment with Course Outcomes</h2>

<p>
This enhancement aligns with the course outcomes of "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals" and "Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources." The implementation of a secure, structured database system and adherence to security best practices like hashed and salted passwords and prepared statements for SQL queries reflects these outcomes.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>

<p>
One of the challenges faced during this enhancement was ensuring data integrity and security, particularly with user authentication and data access controls. This required a deep dive into database security best practices and the implementation of features like password hashing and salting and the use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
</p>

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

<p>
This enhancement demonstrated my abilities in database design and management, secure programming practices, and the application of security principles in software development. It also showcased my adaptability in transitioning the project's data management approach to meet scalability and security requirements.
